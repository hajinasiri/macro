IDiagram Install Notes on DigitalOcean

Droplet Name: idiagram
IP Address: 45.55.23.31
mapname: root
Password: dmsobFoot
was 6315f28632d8e489

For security reasons, you will be required to change this Droplet’s root password when you login. You should choose a strong password that will be easy for you to remember, but hard for a computer to guess. You might try creating an alpha-numerical phrase from a memorable sentence (e.g. “I won my first spelling bee at age 7,” might become “Iwm#1sbaa7”). Random strings of common words, such as “Mousetrap Sandwich Hospital Anecdote,” tend to work well, too.

As an added security measure, we also strongly recommend adding an SSH key to your account. You can do that here: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ssh_keys

db.createmap(

    map: "sitemapAdmin",
    pwd: "dmsobFoot",
    roles: [ { role: "mapAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)

Shut down the mongod from the mongo shell using the db.shutdownServer() method as follows:

use admin
db.shutdownServer()
see if it is gone by typing:
ps aux | grep mongo
