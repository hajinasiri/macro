        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This is a beta version of the Sustainable Finance Map.  The software that drives the map interactivity, and the map content, are works-in-progress.
            </p>
            <p>The goal of the Sustainable Finance System Map is to provide an integrated overview of the various efforts underway to transform finance into an efficient engine of green and equitable growth i.e. shifting capital flows away from ‘dirty’ industries and towards new more resource-efficient and sustainable enterprises.   The map is the result of much desk-research, 50 interviews, a survey, and the critique of 5 workshops.  As we build-out this new interactive version of the map, we will be layering and linking the extensive thinking and content that has gone into the map – we are currently in the early stages of that process.</p>

            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <p>
            As you hover your cursor over different objects in the map, additional details will appear, along with a tooltip providing a short description of that object.
            </p><p>
            If you click on an object to open it, those details will stay on.  Click on the object again to close it and turn the details off.
            </p><p>
            Some elements will fill the 'information pane' on the right with a more detailed information and links.
            </p><p>
            The 'story-pane' on the left, and the 'info-pane' on the right, can be opened/closed/resized using the yellow sliders.
            </p><p>
            Double-clicking on an organization name will open their website in a new window.
