Navigating through the map

The digital platform is structured in three main windows:

1. The main middle window - where the map resides and on which users can navigate through and explore the various elements of the map.

2. The Story-Pane (Left or East) - This pane has a series of links that allow you to navigate through the map stories.  It provides 'short-cuts' to key elements and perspectives already fleshed-out by those involved with the map development as well as additional stories that were built as specific layers of the map.  These are views o the system that you would not find just by navigating directly through the map.

3. The Info-Pane (Right or West) - This pane is home for any additional content related to the map view being explored.  

The side panes can be open/closed by clicking-on the dividers or by using the keys 'w' (for West) or 'e' (for East).
You can also size these panes by dragging the dividers.

There are two main ways in which you can navigate through the map:

1. Simply by following the links on the Story-Pane.

2. Navigating directly over the map - hovering-over, clicking-on (a click will keep them displayed), zooming in and out.  These are basic intuitive ways of navigating through the map.

When you hover or click on certain map objects, additional information about that object will appear in a tooltip and/or the 'Info-Pane' on the right hand side.

Map Objects
Map objects are hierarchically organized and can be opened/closed to show/hide their 'child-objects'. 

Click on an object to open/close that object.

option-click (Alt-click) on an object to open/close all children of that object.

The various elements of the map are built in a number of different layers and when all layers are on at once, it can look crowded and overwhelming.  Hovering-over and clicking on elements can turned on/off the layers.

Pan & Zoom
Mouse and trackpad panning and zooming should work as usual. Or you can use these keys:

[ to zoom out
] to zoom in
\ to zoom all

Use arrows to pan.

%	1.1.2.3	TheProblem	The Problem																	ProjectIntroduction											
The 'gender lens' is a multifaceted concept that varies according to who is applying it, where, and to which issues.  Accelerating the shift of capital towards gender-aware strategies and specific products will require concerted action by stakeholders across finance, business, government, and civil society.  There is a need to facilitate a shared understanding of the systemic nature of and the complexity involved in the issues we're trying to shift, and to develop the coherence and collaboration that will be necessary to break through at scale.
%	1.1.2.4	ProjectObjectives	Project Objectives																	ProjectIntroduction											
The project is focused on promoting the collaboration and coherent actions across the GLI field; to promote a system-wide shift that will increase the level of gender-aware investments.

The system mapping work, within the scope of this project, seeks to deliver on two related goals: 

* Create a view of the current state of Gender Lens investment in the overall financial system ('as is') - a system-wide view that will allow key stakeholders to identify their own perspectives and to recognize that of other diverse players.  This should further the understanding of the multi-faceted elements and relationships that determine the current system's operation - how the various components work together to perform certain functions and deliver certain outcomes, for certain stakeholders.

* Stimulate strategic discussions across the broader system to start creating a clearer picture of who is doing what, what seems to be working, what needs improvement, key leverage points and barriers.  This shared picture will enrich stakeholders' understanding of their different roles in creating change which should in turn encourage concerted actions that will accelerate the shift from discrete achievements to collective change.  

This shared picture will enrich stakeholders' understanding of the different roles we play in creating change, which should in turn encourage concerted actions to accelerate the shift from discrete achievements to collective change.  

This system mapping work is about exploring the multi-faceted world of GL, asking questions and generating insights to drive change.  It is not about designing perfect views of reality nor providing definite answers.


>Blind men and the elephant - a poem bu John -Godfrey Saxe
The second feeling of the tusk, cried: 'Ho! what have we here, so very round and smooth and sharp? To me tis mighty clear, this wonder of an elephant, is very like a spear!'  The third approached the animal, and, happening to take, the squirming trunk within his hands, 'I see,' quoth he, the elephant is very like a snake!'  The fourth reached out his eager hand, and felt about the knee: 'What most this wondrous beast is like, is mighty plain,' quoth he; 'Tis clear enough the elephant is very like a tree.'  The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear, Said; 'E'en the blindest man can tell what this resembles most; Deny the fact who can, This marvel of an elephant, is very like a fan!'  The sixth no sooner had begun, about the beast to grope, than, seizing on the swinging tail, that fell within his scope, 'I see,' quothe he, 'the elephant is very like a rope!'  And so these men of Indostan, disputed loud and long, each in his own opinion, exceeding stiff and strong, Though each was partly in the right, and all were in the wrong!  So, oft in theologic wars, the disputants, I ween, tread on in utter ignorance, of what each other mean, and prate about the elephant, not one of them has seen!

%	1.1.3	MapIntroduction	Map Introduction																	Introductions											
The mapping work is structured in two levels:

1.  The foundational framework encompassing all elements of GLI system - institutions, actors, important relationships - tangible and intangible structural aspects that make the system work as it does.  This framework will enable conversations whether they are already designed over the map or not.

2. Narratives over the map framework.  The critical issues, challenges and ideas of special interest to stakeholders in the GLI community.
%	1.1.3.1	TheMapFramework	The Map Framework																	MapIntroduction											
The map 'framework' attempts to capture a basic economic model of the finance-business-consumer value chains.  These economic activities are in turn embedded in, and influenced or controlled by, the relevant social, political, environmental, and information/knowledge environments in which they operate.  This framework is being refined to  be comprehensive enough to enable conversations on almost any GLI topic; whether or not those topics have been specifically included in our set of key issues and narratives.

The Gender Lens Investment System Map is based on the Sustainable Economy Map, developed for a project driven by Tellus Mater Foundation in the UK.  This original map was developed through a system innovation process which included a great deal of desk-research and engagement of leading experts in the field, through interviews, workshops and a survey.  The original map provides a structural view of the economy that can be used to better direct our Gender Lens investing efforts and drive important systemic change.
%	1.1.3.2	TheMapNarratives	The Map Narratives																	MapIntroduction											
The map 'framework' provides the fundamental building-blocks on which we can map-out the key issues and 'narratives' of interest.  The narratives use the map as a visual story-telling tool that grounds the narratives in the structure of the system and its various actors, the flows of money, information, goods & services, socio-political influence, etc.

The map narratives are a way to think systemically about the multi-faceted world of GLI, and to provide a well-structured tool for integrating information and ideas, asking questions, and generating insights that can drive change.  It is not about achieving a perfect view of reality nor providing definite answers.

In addition to serving as a tool to explaining the various aspects of the GLI system, the narratives capture the key issues, ideas, and challenges across the GLI system.  By situating these narrative within a view of the whole system, we hope to promote conversations that are more connected, systemic and insightful.

In order to better trigger and support these conversations, the narratives have 3 parts:

1. The purpose of the narrative, i.e. why is it worth talking about and what do we hope to achieve through these conversations.

2. An explanation of the issue e.g. the current definition and state-of-play, different points-of-view, relevant references, evidence, etc.

3. A set of questions to prompt discussion and explore the issues relevant to the narrative.

%	1.2.1.1	What-GLIDefinition	What - GLI Definition																	TheBigPicture											
The definition of Gender Lens Investment has been evolving quite significantly over the last few years.  While there's no point in over-defining GLI, consistency in language help stakeholders more precisely delineate what they are talking about, and should make conversations more productive and effective.

Also, by laying-out the different dimensions along which GLI can be considered - which also give rise to it's many possible variants - we promote broader and deeper understanding of the issues, and drive better alignment and decision-making.

Furthermore, other ESG investment lenses - with their attendant criteria - are brought up as important for consideration when discussing Gender Lens Investment. It would be beneficial to acknowledge these additional potentially relevant criteria, and develop strategies that leverage any complementarities.

%	1.2.1.1.3	DefiningelementsofGLI	Defining elements of GLI																	What-GLIDefinition											
Gender lens investing is the deliberate integration of gender factors into financial analysis and decision-making, in order to get to better outcomes. 

Depending on the investor, GLI goals will include some mixture of financial return and affecting change that will improve the wellbeing of women and girls (changes that will reduce risk and improve returns on the investment).  As such, Gender Lens Investment can also be referred to as the deliberate use of capital to improve the lives of women and girls either directly or through getting capital to companies, funds, and investment vehicles with a focus on women throughout value chains, products and services, or leadership.

The gender lenses do not represent a limitation on the investment but an opportunity to see relevant factors, including competitive advantage, that we would miss otherwise. 

This is an area of multi-faceted nature with a number of important variations, consequences of its many interdependent elements. 

Different investors will have specific interests that may or may not be met depending on the products and vehicles available.  

Product availability rely on a number of variables, such as appetite for additional analysis, information collected, and these are, in turn, dependent on businesses practices.

The evidence is now very strong in favour of incorporating GL into portfolio analysis, however it is still important to acknowledge the different interests (and benefits) of a diverse group of stakeholders - from Investors (individuals through to institutional), the banking and finance sector, the corporates with a business perspective, the consumer and the women themselves.

The debate between moral and social change motivations to invest with GL versus a profit driven motivation is a critical one to stimulate and make in roads accordingly.

%	1.2.1.2.3	PerspectivesonBenefits	Perspectives on Benefits																	Why-ThecaseforGLI											
Nowadays, there is growing awareness of social issues and expectations are high with regards to business impact.  There is an increasing number of investors, including a demonstrably significant sized pool of millennials, looking for profit but not necessarily the best beta investments.  Instead these investors when allocating their money, they still look for profit potential, but weighted with other criteria of business impact. 

However, the need to promote social change is not an altruistic need exclusive to philanthropists, more sensitive investors and non-profit organizations.  There is vast research and robust evidence to demonstrate financial benefits of looking through gender lens when making portfolio choices.  These benefits can be identified across the system, from government level through businesses, all the way to individual investors.  "The participation of women in economic activity has and will continue to spur economic growth." The case for Gender Lens Investment is one that can speak to investment stakeholders in a clear, measurable, financial language."
The misconception that there must be a choice between focusing on profit or on impact is to be left in the past.

>Ultimately Gender Lens Investing is about leveraging capital to promote social change - as social change will then lead to better financial outcomes.  It is about addressing current gender inequalities which have dire consequences beyond the social agenda.

####Increased returns

* Catalyst research shows that companies with a higher percentage of women in executive positions have a 34% higher total return to shareholders than those that do not. Another Catalyst study found that companies with the most women directors outperform those with the least on return on invested capital by 26%. 

* McKinsey found that, in a group of publicly traded European companies, those with gender diversity in leadership experienced higher return on equity, operating profit, and stock price. 

* MSCI Inc. studied the financial performance of U.S. companies from 2011-2016 and found that those with at least three women on the board had median gains in return on equity 11% higher, and earnings per share 45% higher, than companies with no women directors. 

* Gallup studied 800 business units from the retail and hospitality industries in 2014. They found that gender-diverse business units had better financial outcomes, including revenue and net profit, than those dominated by one gender. Financial performance was dramatically better for gender-diverse business units that were also highly engaged. 

* Credit Suisse Research Institute reported that companies with at least one woman on their board outperformed the peer group by 26% over the preceding six years.

####The Consumer Market  

>Women control roughly US$20 trillion of total consumer spending globally and influence up to 80 percent of buying decisions. 
In the US, women wield purchasing power in excess of an estimated US$5 trillion.  Women actively use that power to buy half of all computers, half of all cars, and more than 80 percent of all consumer purchases.  They also represent nearly half of all shareholders.

####Talent

>To understand why it is so critical that women play a key role in building--and rebuilding--economies around the world, it's important to consider the rise of  talent as a dominant business issue. In the digital, knowledge economy, human capital replaces natural resources as the basis for growth.

>The businesses and countries that will lead in this century will be the ones that are best able to harness the innovation and creativity of their people.  Women are undoubtedly a growing force in the talent pool. But the real power comes from women and men working together and using their experience to solve complex problems and accelerate
innovation.

####Enterprise Value 

>Operating Margin 
* Reduce costs associated with recruitment, training, and retention 
* Increase efficacy of existing programs and communications because they address all employees 
* Reduce potential liability and legal costs of addressing claims 
Asset Efficiency
* Attract and retain top talent through more role models 
* Increase complex problem-solving capacity through gender diverse teams and leaders 
* Increase innovation through gender diverse teams 
* Increase productivity through improved morale/ esprit de corps 
Revenue Growth
* Leverage women's relationships and experience to attract new business and design new products 
* More effectively sell to this growing market segment 
* Mirror changing complexion of client organizations to compete more effectively

>The evidence is clear: the more women in the workforce, the more per capita income rises (see figure 5 - Correlation of GDP per capita with Global Gender Gap Index ) According to the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD), "since 1995, narrowing the gap between male and female employment rates has accounted for half of the increase in Europe's overall employment rate and a quarter of annual economic growth."34 In Japan, according to the Japanese Economic Foundation, an increase in the number of women in the labor force helped mitigate economic stagnation and kept the economy from a deeper recession.35 In Latin America, working women helped bring the poverty rate for two parent households down to 26 percent, from 40 percent, in 2007. And the World Economic Forum has correlated closing the global gender gap with increased competitiveness and higher GDP per capita.

%	1.2.1.2.4	MarketRisk	Market Risk																	Why-ThecaseforGLI											
The risks that arise from not addressing gender inequality.

Women and girls make up half of the world's population. Given their roles as caregivers, breadwinners, and de facto community leaders, it is not a surprise that strong data links improvements in the lives of women to improvements in  outcomes for families, communities, and global economies. Yet, women around the world experience worse outcomes and have limited opportunities compared to men in many areas of life. Improving women's lives is therefore both a matter of social justice and smart investment for broad social impact.

As a strategic and/or tactical communication issue, do the arguments for GLI begin by framing it as a moral / social change/ human-rights issue, or from a financial-returns / business-case perspective?  How to navigate this "yes, and ..." issue.

There are very real dangers in prioritizing the financial argument, as outlined below, but there is often little appetite in the investment community for conversations that are only focused on the moral and social change issues so we need to acknowledge the various angles and focus the debate accordingly.

>Speaking at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Sarah Kaplan focus on making the "business case" for gender equality by asking three questions:
* What does the research say about the "business case"?
* Why do we need to make a "business case" for women or people of color to be included?
* Why is the moral imperative for gender diversity and inclusion not enough?

>These examples are not mere exceptions to the rule, The most comprehensive survey yet of research into the impacts of payments to promote ecological conservation -- whether to collect more litter and plant more trees or harvest less timber and catch fewer fish -- finds that most of the schemes studied were unintentionally crowding out, rather than crowding in, people's intrinsic motivation to act, 57 Instead of engaging existing intrinsic commitments, such as pride in cultural heritage, respect for the living world, and trust in the community, some schemes inadvertently serve to erode those very values and replace them with financial motivation, ' Using money to motivate people can throw up surprising results, ' says Erik Gómez - Baggethun, one of the study's authors, ' We often don't understand the complex interplay of human values and motivations well enough to anticipate what will happen, and so that calls for caution ', Given that markets do indeed seem to be like fire, here's one way to sum up the moral of the story : 

>Beware before you strike a match or start a market : you never know what riches it may reduce to ashes. "

>Most business and government leaders find it easy to agree with the premise that as a demographic, women hold significant potential for transforming companies, countries, and even the economy as a whole. But that doesn't mean they're doing anything to take advantage of this development. For any, promoting women is still a "soft" issue that is often intangible and viewed as a  matter of "personal virtue" rather than a business imperative.  

>What may be missing in many of these instances is the hard, cold fact that not capitalizing on women as workers and consumers has real impact on the bottom line and overall success of an organization. To bring home this reality, investing in women must be taken out of the realm of ideology and into the executive suite, or better yet, the balance sheet. Promoting women needs to be viewed as any other business decision--and that involves building a  solid business case. When a company proposes to invest in cyber-security or seek to become more vertically integrated or decides to switch to a new technology platform, the impact on the  bottom line is always analyzed and weighed. Investing in women should be no different.
But the business case is only the beginning. Programs and initiatives will need to follow that promote and support women and a proactive push must be made to include women at every level of an organization.
Only by embedding gender diversity into the core decision-making processes of a  company can the true Gender Dividend be reaped.

Getting into the 'nitty gritty' of gender analysis.  How do we make decisions when investing with Gender Lens?  What factors should we take into account?  Again, the multi-faceted nature of GL makes the 'nitty gritty' a rich subject for conversation.

In this narrative we introduce the many possible elements considered for Gender Lens investing.  We want to trigger discussions around key challenges related to analyzing Gender performance, from Principles, through Criteria and Standards, Investment Thesis and Products to Real Outcome. 

Adding to the complexity in this arena, we should also explore how different factors are relevant according to each investment strategy, individuals preferences, availability of data level or reliability of the data, etc.

Even though the demand is there and the business case seems clear, there is still a lot of work to be done to maximize the level of Gender Lens Investing.  Depending on who you ask 'how can I invest with a Gender Lens?' the answer will both vary widely as well as fall short of sophistication. 

There is a need to be more effective in terms of identifying where the best opportunities lie, those of higher impact, whichever the individual angle might be, whether one is looking for better financials or better impact socially.  More sophisticated approaches are called for to help investors who are looking for broad social impact or specific gender issues such as safety or health.

From:  Principles --. Criteria --> Standards --> Investment thesis

To make GLI mainstream, there is also a need to drive consistency and efficiency throughout the process of gathering, reporting, analyzing and creating insights and most importantly, implementing  it - applying it to build fit-for-purpose investment products and portfolios.  Different organizations and stakeholders will focus on different areas of interest and as such, create own criteria and taxonomies for those (e.g. 3 Gender Lens ) 

Furthermore, how do different non-financial performance criteria, environmental or broader social ones, co-relate or work together somewhat?  

>The data clearly shows that time alone will not ensure that organizations reap the Gender Dividend; rather, there needs to be a clear, strategic focus on gender. Consider this: a 2010 global survey of executives found that 72 percent agree that there is a direct connection  between gender diversity and business success, but only 28 percent say it is a top-10 priority for senior leadership.41 And while many leading companies have a number of women-focused initiatives in place at any given moment, they don't seem to be achieving the goal of consistently moving women into key decision making and leadership roles--the roles that have the most impact on business success.

>The Aperio Women's Inclusion (AWI) strategy is a public markets investment opportunity which uses a gender lens. Investors can use the strategy to track one of four broad-based equity indices (S&P 500, MSCI AWCI, MSCI EAFE, and Russell 3000). Aperio seeks to match the beta, or risk level, of the relevant index while increasing the "social score" of the overall portfolio. The AWI scoring strategy uses what is commonly referred to as a "best in class" ESG methodology to apply weights to the underlying companies in order to improve the portfolio characteristics in regards to gender issues.

####Misconceptions on measurements  

>On a widely used risk metric--the debt to equity ratio-- we find almost no difference between companies with no women on the board and those with at least one woman on the board in terms of their appetite for debt; in fact, we note that companies with more than 15% of women in the top management show significantly higher debt to equity ratios, compared to those with less than 10%. This may confound some who have suggested women operate an inherently risk averse approach. We find little evidence to support this where debt is concerned.

* What is the 'running list' of criteria?  Are there priority criteria?

* What is precision of value?

* What is the evidence that they matter and their relative importance?  What is the co-relation between criteria to be measured and system desired outcome? 

* Should there be different sets of criteria to somewhat match the diversity of the investors pool?  What are the main sets/ groups of criteria to be considered?

* What different evidence can be used to support use of different criteria e.g. Lens of Products and Services that help solve women's issues could use XX Factor 5 Dimensions and 10 best bets

* How robust are those as a basis for decision-making? How much do they co-relate to specific goals?

* How reliable is the data available?  How do we make sure we are measuring the right things, right?   Parallel with environmental narrowness.  The parallel with 'Green washing', what's really good/green?: depending on the data provided you might think something is sustainably produced just to find out that across the value chain it is not really e.g solar panels old production materials, electric cars' batteries.

* Focusing on Symptoms vs Root Causes?

* Long term vs Short term results?

* What is lacking?

* How are these issues, and others, reflected in ESG criteria? In the E, the S, or the G?

* Issue with narrowness (easier to agree and measure but over simplistic) / broadness of Portfolio Criteria (sophisticated indicators but hard to get implemented).

* The problem of overly narrow gender criteria.

* Gender criteria and what other criteria - other ESG / impact factors

%	1.2.2.1.2	GL-Media	GL - Media																	GLIEnablers											
The way that gender lens is portrayed in the media can influence the thinking across the institutional investment supply chain: from beneficiaries through to corporate managers.  Media and campaigning can play an important role in keeping gender lens on the agenda and providing a constructive view of finance as a vital part of the solution, while also dispelling the debilitating notions of uncertainty, powerlessness, and shifting of responsibility. 

Media channels have the responsibility of promoting relevant and truthful information to people.   

Momentum has been building up and across the world people are mobilising behind the women equality agenda.  Engaged consumers will demand more socially responsible products and services, including investment products.  Engaged and well informed citizens will require government leadership in important issues.    

Media plays a key role in raising awareness of the issues, creating conversations around difficult questions and promoting people's voices to make the required changes to the system.

Data - quality and reliable data - is a powerful enabler of change, promoting awareness, transparency, trust. Increasing product availability.

A system wide solution to better enable gender lens investment will require significant multi-stakeholder engagement, creative thinking, discipline and a strong concerted effort across the board...

Data providers and data analysis agencies are at different points in the journey to incorporating appropriate tools and practices into their work in order to provide more comprehensive market insights.  These providers are known historically as financial data vendors and therefore data sets on which investment decisions are made remain largely traditional and predominantly focused on profitability, despite recent pressures to provide assessments relating to sustainability.  A gender lens applied to investment strategies will require the adoption of a broader consistent data set which as yet does not exist across the investment landscape.  There are a few initiatives in which gender is to be used as a factor of analysis in ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) however these are still not consistent analysis nor systematically applied.

>Leverage points are places within a complex system where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything.  This idea is not unique to systems analysis -- it's embedded in legend. The silver bullet, the trimtab, the miracle cure, the secret passage, the magic password, the single hero who turns the tide of history. The nearly effortless way to cut through or leap over huge obstacles. 
We not only want to believe that there are leverage points, we want to know where they are and how to get our hands on them. Leverage points are points of power.  

(Donella Meadows)

By understanding systems components and relationships, overtime one can understand where the Leverage Points are and maximise efforts by focusing change efforts on initiatives that take advantage of these.

The starting position for Leverage Points identified on this map comes from the work done with the Sustainable Finance Project with Tellus Mater.  The focus of that exercise, captured on the Leverage Point slide, was to identify initiatives and players working on each of the leverage points.

We have now an opportunity to revisit these Leverage Points in the context of Gender Lens Investment and really explore where the high leverage points are, why these are leverage points, what can be done and who is already working on these.  This should then help the community mobilise efforts for best return.

Pressure to provide assessments relating to sustainability and more recently increased requirements for other Social indicators *including gender) puts the spot light on current players to step up in their role, brings new players into the scene and most importantly, changes the dynamics of how data is gathered, analysed and how insights are created for action.

From Cornerstone Capital: Recently, Cornerstone Capital's Head of Impact Strategy, Katherine Pease, sat down for an in-depth discussion with two leading figures in the field of gender-focused investment and philanthropy, to discuss the role that investors and finance can play in addressing gender-based violence in companies and society.

>https://criterioninstitute.org/resources/video-a-spiral-of-change-understanding-the-investment-impact-of-sexual-and-gender-based-violence

Teresa Younger is the President and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women. A noted speaker, advocate, and activist, Teresa has been on the frontlines of some of the most important battles for women's health, safety and economic justice.

Joy Anderson is the founder and president of Criterion Institute. Criterion is a leading think tank focused on using finance as a tool for social change. Criterion played a significant role in creating and building the field of gender lens investing and continues to shape how gender matters in the analyses, structures, and processes of investment and finance.

The discussion centered on the following questions:

What is changing in the field around gender-based violence?
How can we embrace this moment to facilitate change?
What data is available, and what data and disclosures do we need going forward?
What are the key questions that investors can start asking today?
What can investors do to support the effort to address gender-based violence in companies and society?

It was evident that society's awareness of gender-based violence and the impact of gender issues more broadly is evolving. Teresa referred to the "spiral process" of understanding the challenges and potential solutions--i.e., we learn more about a subject each time the topic is encountered, expanding our knowledge and our ability to tackle this difficult issue.

####Preamble  

This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these did not achieve. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.

Capital markets are phenomenally important to society; they are the 'invisible hand' that guides the production and distribution of goods and services. Markets have enabled specialization, trade, and sharing of risk, which has supported the global economic rise from subsistence-level poverty. Markets help to provide for our education, our food, our energy, our healthcare and our housing. Markets allocate capital to innovative research and development projects that continually improve the efficiency and effectiveness of economic activity. From this perspective, capital markets are the means by which we build our culture, values and ambitions.

However, we have become increasingly concerned that capital markets are built on unsustainable foundations, and the purpose of this analysis is to provide people involved in policy-making with specific suggestions as to how they can move the capital markets onto a more sustainable basis: by raising capital for sustainable uses, moving capital from unsustainable practices, and harnessing the stewardship capabilities of investors. In formulating these proposals, we focus on sustainable development issues that are relevant to business performance, and aim to be ambitious and systemic, yet proportionate and practical.

Our goal, paraphrasing the Brundtland definition of sustainable development, is to promote capital markets that finance the need of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, creating a finance system that supports long-term value creation, rather than short-term profit making at the expense of future generations.

We have produced this interactive map to help policy-makers better understand the capital market system and how it can be made more sustainable, and made to better support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It depicts the flow of capital and the key financial institutions that operate between the demand and supply of capital. Each of these financial institutions are important and each plays a different role and can influence change in a different way.  We use this view of the financial market system as a tool to analyse the deficiencies in the current system, and then make specific recommendations for how sustainability can be better integrated into the financial supply chain.

It is important that the incentives for the various capital market participants be aligned with long-term resilience and sustainable production. 


Market failure refers to the situation where it pays companies in the long term to do the wrong thing and be unsustainable. In other words, a market failure is where the externalities associated with unsustainable business practices do not hit the company's profit and loss statement (P&L) at all. As mentioned earlier, this is largely because global governments have not taken corrective action to internalise the costs onto corporate balance sheets

The transition to a more efficient and zero-carbon production system will require a huge influx of new capital, and this should present a major opportunity for forward-looking investors. 


####Raising Capital for Sustainable Development  

The International Energy Agency estimates that incremental investment in the energy sector alone will need to reach around $1 trillion a year from 2012 to 2050 in order to keep global average warming below 2 degrees Celsius.  More capital will also be required to finance the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals that look likely to succeed them.  The MDGs were the most broadly supported, comprehensive, and specific poverty reduction targets the world has ever established but no mechanism was agreed for how they could be financed.  A vitally important part of the process to design new goals will be an associated agreement on the Means of Implementation (MOI) outlining how the goals will be achieved.  A key part of MOI (and quite often the most contentious element) is about who and how to finance any such international agreements.  

While the precise amount is open to question, it is clear that significant sums of money will be required.  Raising this money will need considerable planning, effort and international coordination.  Failure to tackle this will have serious economic consequences in the relatively short term.  The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change conducted for the UK treasury in 2006 found that without action, the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and in perpetuity.  Including a wider range of risks and impacts could increase this to 20% of GDP or more, also indefinitely.  Stern believes that 5-6 degrees of temperature increase is "a real possibility." However, the costs of taking mitigating action were estimated to be around 1% of global GDP.  

As an insurer, we are accustomed to dealing with financial arguments that point towards the benefits of taking preventative and mitigating action before a much more expensive disaster unfolds.  The economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters totaled $56 billion in the first half of 2013 according to Swiss Re, with $17 billion covered by the global insurance industry and caused by natural catastrophes, mainly flooding.  History has shown that political will often depends on the presence of a crisis.  We believe that the implied changes to the global economic system associated with a 5-6 degree change and unsustainable economic development present such a crisis.  Fortunately, with over $50 trillion invested in the global stock markets, and a further $100 trillion of sovereign and intergovernmental debt, on the face of it, there should be no shortage of capital available.  

The short fall we perceive is a broad enough understanding of how to harness capital markets to raise new capital, move existing stock of capital and harness the influence of asset owners in a concerted, integrated and focused way.  Intergovernmental organisations have traditionally been good at sourcing public financing but not yet as successful in leveraging private finance.  If we are to raise this money in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner, **we collectively need to challenge the international community to develop a well considered international capital raising plan** that coordinates national plans and includes a view on the money that can be raised via infrastructure investment, project finance, corporate debt, foreign direct investment, equity investment as well as sovereign and MDB debt.  

Raising and or diverting capital on this scale is likely to provide a significant number of practical challenges that policy makers developing such a plan will need to consider.  

In order to catalyse policy makers into developing a set of capital raising plans this, we propose the following actions: 1.  The establishment of a focused group of finance sector chief executives that are willing to take on a high-level advocacy role at a small number of the key meetings with Finance Ministers, and UN negotiators;  

2.  The publication of a range of research notes tackling some of key questions that the policy makers setting the national and international capital raising frameworks will need to consider.  This will also include broker notes setting out why the current performance of the policy makers falls a long way short of moving the markets over a time frame that is supported by the science.  These finance sector papers would be provided to the Expert Committee on a Sustainable Development Financing Strategy;  

3.  The development of a capacity building course that uses the research notes to train policy makers, NGOs and negotiators in governmental and nongovernmental organisations on how the capital markets work and how they can be better harnessed to influence sustainable development.  

These aims are consistent with the United Nations Environment Programme Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System, which we are pleased to be working with.

This set of deficiencies in the current finance system prevent it from properly supporting sustainable businesses. 


Here we identify the some of the issues that need to be addressed to make the system more sustainable. 
The key sustainability problem with the existing capital markets is that the cost of capital for companies is not sufficiently influenced by how sustainable the company is. In other words, sustainability issues do not matter enough to ensure that the performance is sustainable. We believe that this is for two related reasons: market inefficiency and market failure. 
%	4.4.2.1	MarketFailures	Market Failures																	BarrierstoSustainableCapitalMarkets											
A market failure is a failure of **governments** to create market price mechanisms that compel companies to pay the costs of their externalities. 


Market failure refers to the situation where it pays companies in the long term to do the wrong thing and be unsustainable. In other words, a market failure is where the externalities associated with unsustainable business practices do not hit the company's profit and loss statement (P&L) at all. As mentioned earlier, this is largely because global governments have not taken corrective action to internalise the costs onto corporate balance sheets 
%	4.4.2.2	MarketInefficiencies	Market Inefficiencies																	BarrierstoSustainableCapitalMarkets											
Capital market inefficiency is a failure of the predictive power of **investors** – which leads to the misallocation of capital to less sustainable businesses. 


Market inefficiency is used here to refer to the situation where it pays companies to do the right thing and be sustainable, but markets neither recognize nor reward this behaviour until the company delivers the results within their accounts. In other words, while companies plan to be sustainable, investors do not proactively see the business case and their ensuing investment decisions do not contribute towards lowering a company's short term cost of capital, until the benefits are obvious to all. This time lag can punish more sustainable companies via a higher cost of capital until the benefits of their behaviour appear in their accounts. 
%	4.4.2.3	PervasiveShort-Termism	Pervasive Short-Termism																	BarrierstoSustainableCapitalMarkets											
In general, market participants are incentivized to focus on narrow (i.e. purely financial) and short-term goals. 


The inter-generational aspects in the above definition of corporate sustainability hints at how it links to short termism.  Short termism itself refers to the maximization of short-term profitability.  This can be a long-term problem for the economy as a whole: if the capital market does not sufficiently factor in long-term capital investment returns, then it undermines long-term investment decision-making by company directors and leads them to allocate insufficient capital to investing in the long term health of companies overall.  In other words, short termism by companies stems from short term investors exerting pressure on company executives.  While a lack of focus on the long-term financial health of a company is a general problem, short-termism is also a particular problem for sustainable development as it systematically erodes incentives for company directors to invest in a sustainable strategy that considers how a range of environmental, social and governance issues impact the future success of the business.  

The Aspen Institute has published a set of guiding principles for "Long-Term Value Creation" that aimed to invigorate *"the ability of business to serve as the driver of long-term economic growth on a national scale, and to more fully serve the public good" *.  It considers the role of investors in exacerbating short termism and suggested that company boards should * "De-emphasize short-term financial metrics such as quarterly [earnings per share] and emphasize specific forward-looking metrics that the board of directors determines are appropriate to the long-term, strategic goals of the firm and that are consistent with the core principles of long-term sustainable growth, and long-term value creation for investors"* (Aspen Institute, 2007, p2).  

The United Nations backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) highlights the importance of the long term in its definition of responsible investment: *"an approach to investment that explicitly acknowledges the relevance to the investor of environmental, social and governance factors, and of the long-term health and stability of the market as a whole.  It recognizes that the generation of long-term sustainable returns is dependent on stable, well-functioning and well governed social, environmental and economic systems."* The PRI encourages asset managers and asset owners to integrate ESG issues into their investment decision making, as well as into the messages that they send to corporate boards as company owners.  Responsible investment, therefore, helps deal with short termism by encouraging boards to focus on long term profit maximization.  
%	4.4.2.4	MisalignedIncentives	Misaligned Incentives																	BarrierstoSustainableCapitalMarkets											
The incentive structures of market participants are extremely important, but unfortunately they are not currently well-aligned with long-term broad-based social, environmental, and economic resilience. 


One of the main sources of market inefficiency is an excessively short-term view among the market participants who are more concerned about short term costs or benefits of an initiative than the long term costs or benefits arising from it.  The short termism argument rests on the capital market being too near-sighted in the way it evaluates companies.

One root cause is that fund management organisations are evaluated by their clients – for example pension funds – based on criteria that are themselves too short term.  Such evaluation motivates short-term investment behaviour on the part of fund managers that is more akin to speculation than to genuine ownership.  Fund managers are subject to a legal fiduciary duty to obtain the best risk adjusted financial returns for their clients, and this is often evaluated on the basis of very short-term, even daily results.  In an ideal world, their interest would be in the long term, but the structure of the market pushes them into maximising short-term returns.

As previously outlined, this maximisation of short-term results is a long-term problem for the economy as a whole: if the capital market does not sufficiently factor in long-term capital investment returns, then it undermines long-term investment decision-making by company directors and leads them to allocate insufficient capital to investing in the long term health of companies overall.  While a lack of focus on the long-term financial health of a company is a general problem, short-termism is also a particular problem for sustainable development: it systematically erodes incentives for company directors to invest in a sustainable business.  

A Tomorrow's Company report commissioned by Aviva Investors confirmed this thinking and found that potential conflicts in the capital market supply chain:  

**• Pension fund trustees:** the close and frequent monitoring of fund management performance by trustees can result in fund managers feeling pressured to maintain high levels of short-term performance relative to the benchmark to retain funds; 66% of pension funds formally review fund manager performance every quarter (92% annually or less), despite 62% of them claiming that the key investment period for trustees appearing is longer than a rolling or calendar year (Source: "NAPF/IMA Short-Termism Study Report", MORI, 2004).  This can create incentives that affect fund managers' approach to risk taking.  

**• Investment consultants:** The degree to which investment consultants take into account factors relating to the long-term sustainability of companies is dependent on: (i) the degree to which pension fund trustees wish to take them into account; (ii) the cost of maintaining dedicated research teams and (iii) the availability of good long-term comparable data.  Investment consultants also tend to charge a fixed hourly rate and therefore have an incentive to be active in order to maximise their income.  They therefore offer an increasingly wide range of services that they encourage trustees to use.  There is an opportunity to generate substantial income through the fund manager selection process, so consultants may be incentivised to encourage fund manager turnover.  

**• Brokers:** the remuneration of brokers is directly linked to trading volumes.  As a result they have a powerful incentive to encourage market activity.  Even when sell-side analysts are aware of corporate governance or sustainability concerns, these analysts do not report this in their reports to buyside analysts for fear of losing access to those boards.  

**• Stock exchanges:** Nearly half of all exchanges are companies listed on their own exchange and are therefore subject to shareholder pressure to maximise returns.  The largest sources of revenue for demutualised, for-profit stock exchanges are reliant on market activity.  This results in an incentive for exchanges to create inducements for trading activity.  

In order to change this, simple measures could be implemented to align these incentives.  For example, to expand on the specific example regarding investment consultants: the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative's Asset Management Working Group (UNEP FI AMWG) has called for actions that they believe will magnify the extent to which responsible investment is demanded by the capital markets.  They proposed that *"Global capital market policymakers should make it clear that advisors to institutional investors have a duty to proactively raise ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance] issues within the advice that they provide, and that a responsible investment option should be the default position.  Furthermore, policymakers should ensure prudential regulatory frameworks that enable greater transparency and disclosure from institutional investors and their agents on the integration of ESG issues into their investment process, as well as from companies on their performance on ESG issues."* (UNEP, 2009)

The report also proposes clauses on responsible investment that should be written into fund management contracts and that fund managers' performance should be based on an evaluation of their long-term ability to beat benchmarks.  Moreover, as a result of the potential for unsustainable development to harm the absolute value of long-term investment portfolios, the report also proposed that investment consultant and fund manager clients should be able to sue for negligence if these issues are not properly considered.

More generally, we believe that various market participants should be incentivised to change their behaviour in order to achieve a culture shift in financial institutions.  We support, for example, the abolition of quarterly reporting and similarly believe that fund manager performance should be reviewed over longer time horizons than the typical quarterly cycle.  Such evaluation based on short-term returns undermines long term sustainable development; for the same reason excessive reliance on measuring performance relative to a market index should be reduced.

In order to align incentives for the long-term (as highlighted by Tomorrow's Company) pension funds should be required to integrate voting and engagement policies into the investment process; shareowner activism should be given more weight in the selection and retention of fund managers and other matters; all advisors to institutional investors should have a duty to proactively raise ESG issues and encourage adherence to the Stewardship Code; fund management contracts and fund managers' performance should include an evaluation of long-term ability to beat benchmarks; investment consultants' fee structures should not reward them for moving clients between fund managers; and within companies the implementation of strong cultural norms should be supported by independent whistle-blowing mechanisms, overseen by professional bodies who offer the whistle-blower appropriate protection.  
%	4.4.2.5	LackofInformation&Transparency	Lack of Information & Transparency																	BarrierstoSustainableCapitalMarkets											
Investment decisions are driven by information.  If investors do not have access to consistent, timely, and appropriate ESG information, **and** if they don't have the appropriate sustainability knowledge to make sense of and care about that information, then it will be impossible for them to make more sustainable choices.  


The ability to assess a company's overall governance and performance in the context of these non-financial factors is of central importance to institutional investors and the ultimate beneficiaries for whom they act, as well as employees, governments and society as a whole.  Information is the life blood of capital markets.  If the information that the market participants have to rely upon is short term and thin, then these are the characteristics that will define our market.

Unfortunately, the current reporting model, framed by International Financial Reporting Standards, national standards and stock exchange rules, does not provide the necessary framework to enable nonfinancial factors to be taken into account systematically in reporting and decision making.  Bloomberg data shows us that of 25,000 companies surveyed, 75% do not report on even one data point of sustainability information (Corporate Knights Capital Study, 2013).

As a result, undue focus and reliance is placed on short-term financial performance, with the risk that capital is not being directed efficiently towards those companies that have robust business models, that make a meaningful contribution towards the achievement of a sustainable society and which outperform in environmental, social and governance terms.

In order to promote change in this area, in 2008 Aviva Investors called for a debate with stock market listing authorities regarding how they could integrate sustainability issues into the listing rules of stock exchanges.  We wanted to explore how exchanges can work together with investors, regulators, and companies to enhance corporate transparency, and ultimately performance, on environmental, social and corporate governance issues and encourage responsible long-term approaches to investment.

This initiative has evolved to become the UN Sustainable Stock Exchange initiative and is led by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), The UN Global Compact (UNGC), The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).  It was named by Forbes magazine as one of the "World's Best Sustainability Ideas" in 2010.

While a number of important debates on stock exchanges and sustainability have taken place since this time, these debates have largely focused on encouraging voluntary action by national stock exchanges.  A number of exchanges have taken some action – particularly in emerging markets – and this should be welcomed.  However, none of the debates so far have managed to reach out beyond the stock exchanges themselves and successfully engage their regulators.  This is a key strategic problem as many of the largest exchanges have said they are concerned that they will lose corporate listing business to other exchanges if they move ahead of national regulators and the international community by embedding sustainability disclosure requirements on their exchanges.  Conversely, one of the key constraints referenced by capital market participants is the lack of corporate disclosure in the area of environmental, social and corporate governance performance.  Consequently, there is a case for internationally coordinated action.

Recognising this problem, the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative produced "A Report on Progress" for their 2012 Global Dialogue.  This report included a survey of stock exchanges and found that a minimum level of comparability across markets is needed.  At the time, more than three quarters of stock exchange respondents to the survey welcomed a global approach to consistent and material corporate sustainability reporting.  Further, 75 per cent of stock exchange respondents favoured internationally coordinated action via a convention on corporate sustainability reporting.  The report's recommendations included that: *"Regulators should work with policymakers in developing an international policy framework requiring, on a comply or explain basis, listed companies to provide material and consistent ESG disclosures."* And that policymakers should *"set a roadmap for the development of an international policy framework that supports improved and consistent ESG disclosure by listed companies across markets"*.  
More generally, Aviva Investors and Standard and Poor's commissioned CK Capital's 2013 report on corporate sustainability disclosure practices shows that growth in the number of companies disclosing a core set of seven basic sustainability indicators is slowing.  While the absolute number of listed companies that disclose these seven indicators has increased markedly since the early 2000s, the disclosure rate is slowing.  Most of the indicators remain undisclosed by over half of the world's large listed companies.  By analysing the relative performance of different countries in this area, they concluded that achieving complete disclosure across these seven metrics will "almost certainly require new types of intervention by regulators, including securities regulators and stock exchanges".  

Examining disclosure rates by region, the report shows that emerging markets-based stock exchanges - such as those based in Brazil, India, Mexico, Singapore and South Africa - are quickly catching up to their counterparts in the developed world - such as the Deutsche Börse, the Euronext Paris, the London Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.  A key factor in this process is the leadership position that many emerging markets-based exchanges have established by embedding sustainability disclosure requirements into their listing guidance and – with the support of the listing authority – their listing rules.  Leaders in this area include the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Brazilian stock exchange BM&F BOVESPA, and both the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges in India.  The CK Capital report also finds evidence to support policies that are (i) mandatory as opposed to voluntary, (ii) prescriptive as opposed to principles-based, and (iii) broad as opposed to sector-specific.  

In November 2013, the UN Conference on Trade and Development produced UN guidance (UNCTAD, 2013) setting out how stock exchange regulators can promote sustainability reporting.  The guidance sought to assist stock exchanges and corporate reporting regulators in the context of an international trend wherein stock exchanges and regulators in several countries are introducing new sustainability reporting initiatives.  

The key recommendations of the UNCTAD guidance are as follows:  

• Introducing voluntary sustainability reporting initiatives can be a practical first step to allow companies time to develop the capacity to prepare high-quality sustainability reports.  

• Mandatory sustainability reporting initiatives can be introduced on a comply or explain basis, to establish a clear set of disclosure expectations while allowing for flexibility and avoiding an undue burden on enterprises.  

• Stock exchanges and/or regulators should consider advising the market on the future direction of sustainability reporting rules.  Companies should be allotted sufficient time to adapt, especially if stock exchanges or regulators are considering moving from a voluntary approach to a mandatory approach.  

• Stock exchanges and regulators should consider highlighting sustainability issues in their existing definitions of what constitutes material information for the purposes of corporate reporting.  

• With a view to promoting an internationally harmonized approach, stock exchanges and regulators should consider basing sustainability reporting initiatives on an international reporting framework.  

Integrated Reporting is a market-led initiative that seeks to provide a more concise and relevant explanation to providers of financial capital about how a business is creating value over the short, medium and long-term.  It aims to shape the future of corporate reporting by providing more useful information to investors, supporting their capital allocation decisions and contributing to a more financially stable and sustainable economic environment.  Integrated Reporting is defined as a process, founded on 'integrated thinking', that results in a periodic Integrated Report about value creation over time, and related communications regarding aspects of value creation by an organization.  

Reporting of this type has been recommended by a significant number of the key reports considering what the SDGs should include.  For example: The UN High Level Panel Report8:  

• *Governments can... prompt their large multinational corporations to report on the social, environmental, and economic impact of their activities.  *  

• *We suggest that a mandatory 'comply or explain' regime be phased in for all companies with a market capitalisation above $100 million equivalent.  *  

• *The Panel proposes that, in future – at latest by 2030 – all large businesses should be reporting on their environmental and social impact – or explain why if they are not doing so.*  

The Sustainable Development Solutions Network Report9:  

• *Companies must be accountable for adverse environmental and social consequences of their actions, along the lines of the "polluter pays" and "payment for ecosystem services" principles.  In particular this will require better ways of measuring the value and true performance of companies by internalizing externalities in companies' reporting and ensuring transparent independent evaluation for all major corporations.  *  

• *Target 10a: Governments (national and local) and business commit to the SDGs, transparent monitoring, and annual reports- including independent evaluation of integrated reporting for all major companies starting no later than 2020.  *

• *Governments should ask companies to enhance accountability and transparency through publicly disclosing sustainability practices – especially in an integrated fashion that recognizes financial, natural and social capital – and through frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative.  *  

Fortunately, therefore, it would appear that the SDGs are likely to address one of the key reasons for market inefficiency from the sustainability perspective.  However, our concern that corporate reporting in isolation is not enough.  In order to ensure that the capital markets use and reinforce the information published within the integrated report, the targets need to address the entire system.  

Therefore, with reference to Figure 1 on page 22, we suggest targets addressing the entire supply chain of capital, and detail our suggested goals in Section 7 below.  The key point is that by addressing goals that are bespoke to each of the key intermediaries in the capital market chain, the SDGs can help to ensure that the capital markets support sustainable development.

There is a general lack of knowledge by market participants about what the sustainability issues are, and why they matter so much.  The combination of sustainability knowledge **and** ESG information is required to for market participants to make better decisions.  


This is closely related to the corporate sustainability reporting issue where market participants need to be able to see corporate performance. However, simply providing this information does not guarantee that investors will be interested, nor ensure that they will know how to use it. There is a lack of concern among market participants on the costs and benefits of corporate sustainability that partly emerges due to a lack of knowledge about how much these issues matter. 

One practical way of changing this over time would be for the most highly regarded fund manager and analyst training centres around the world such as the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute to ensure that their training syllabus and – crucially – the charter holder examination11 improve the ability of analysts to think through how the sustainable development work of companies will enhance corporate valuation. Universities should also update the content of their finance and business related qualifications – particularly the MBA and Masters in Finance – to include sustainability awareness.

Misallocation of capital is the primary failure of the capital markets in relation to sustainable development. It is 'misallocated' because it does not fully incorporate social and environmental externalities, and thus leads to investments that can cause social and environmental degradation.

This is our set of proposals for capital market reform: a set of systemic interventions designed to work in concert; reinforcing each other and ensuring alignment throughout the capital supply chain. 


These are our proposals for government action: a set of systemic interventions designed to work in concert, reinforcing each other and ensuring alignment throughout the financial supply chain. These actions will harness the energy and creativity of market forces to fuel truly sustainable development; supplying the flow of capital needed to fund the SDGs.

We have used the definition enshrined within the Brundtland report to define integrated capital markets as: *capital markets that finance development that meets the need of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.*  

In order to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to make strategic interventions throughout the capital supply chain. In order to make such systemic recommendations, we have used this map of the finance system to better understand the different players and how their actions link together. This set of integrated solutions offers specific actions that Governments can take to encouraged each part of the system to integrate sustainability. These recommendations are based on our view of existing best practices in integrating sustainability within each type of institution.

%	4.4.3.1	IntegratedReporting	Integrated Reporting																	IntegratedSolutions											
Improve Integrated Reporting by companies, investment banks, stock exchanges, asset managers, investment consultants, asset owners and proxy voting agencies: Governments to establish a national legislative framework requiring participants in the capital market supply chain to produce an integrated sustainability report to society – on a mandatory comply or explain basis. 


Integrated reporting by companies is fundamental to the ability to execute responsible investment strategies. Integrated reporting itself is defined by the International Integrated Reporting Council as: "a concise communication about how an organization's strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term". Measures of environmental and social capital are disclosed alongside to the more commonplace measures of financial stocks and flows published in a conventional report and accounts  

Without Integrated Reporting, investors are unable to integrate the ESG performance measures of corporate sustainability into their valuation work. As a result, a company's cost of capital does not reflect its sustainability. This is critically important: the aggregate investment decisions of analysts and fund managers are powerful because they influence the terms on which companies raise capital. These terms can be central to achieving a competitive advantage and influence the ease with which companies go about their businesses. If the finance market does not integrate sustainability into their investment decisions, then it will not motivate corporations to improve their sustainability.

Data providers and data analysis agencies are at different points in the journey to incorporating appropriate tools and practices into their work in order to provide more comprehensive market insights.  These providers are known historically as financial data vendors and therefore data sets on which investment decisions are made remain largely traditional and predominantly focused on profitability, despite recent pressures to provide assessments relating to sustainability.  A gender lens applied to investment strategies will require the adoption of a broader consistent data set which as yet does not exist across the investment landscape.  There are a few initiatives in which gender is to be used as a factor of analysis in ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) however these are still not consistent analysis nor systematically applied.

Structural changes are needed to revert corporate behaviour associated with gender inequality, whether it is to secure shareholder return or to protect their reputation, which in turn secures long term return.  Businesses are under increasing pressure from shareholders and consumers to demonstrate ethics towards women.

As a natural consequence businesses are required to report on new social  (as well as environmental) metrics and this is causing an overload of compliance which also needs to be dealt with.
%	5.5.7	GL-ShareholderActivism	GL - Shareholder Activism																	GL-Roles											

Shareholder activists are increasingly active in using their rights as shareholders of publicly-traded companies to bring about change within or for the corporations.  Issues addressed by these activists are for social change and their methods range from dialogue with managers to formal proposals, which are voted on by all shareholders at a company's annual meeting.   

Recently hedge funds have been pushing for change, related to their partners' environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns with top funds prioritizing ESG in various forms. Some of these funds are being pushed by their own investors, who seek to own firms, which demonstrate commitment to corporate social responsibility. The prediction is that we would continue to see an increase in shareholder activism in 2018.  Activist funds frequently hold positions for longer than typical equities hedge funds, and have concentrated portfolios to allow them to take significant stakes in the companies where they are pushing for performance-enhancing changes. They say that improvements in board diversity, employee retention, environmental policies, supply chain ethics and data security and privacy -- all common ESG concerns -- can drive earnings and limit the risks of costly litigation or run-ins with regulators.

The increasing pressure and momentum moving the women's agenda forward will increase individuals' demands for businesses to be socially responsible.  People are sharpening their understanding of gender inequality and how their buying and investment decisions can be part of the solution.

Credit Suisse: The CS Gender 3000 report:
"On a widely used risk metric--the debt to equity ratio-- we find almost no difference between companies with no women on the board and those with at least one woman on the board in terms of their appetite for debt; in fact, we note that companies with more than 15% of women in the top management show significantly higher debt to equity ratios, compared to those with less than 10%. This may confound some who have suggested women operate an inherently risk averse approach. We find little evidence to support this where debt is concerned."

HBR: We Recorded VCs' Conversations and Analyzed How Differently They Talk about Female Entrepreneurs:
"Because the purpose of government venture capital is to use tax money to stimulate growth and value creation for society as a whole, gender bias presents the risk that the money isn't being invested in businesses that have the highest potential."

"Evidence has found that women business owners start and raise less capital than their male counterparts. Yet, the credit risk of women-owned firms that are six or more years old are indistinguishable from their male counterparts, according to Small Business Credit Survey Report on Women-Owned Firms. The under-capitalization of women-owned firms places significant limits on their growth."

Athena Capital: Investing in Gender Equity
"The Aperio Women's Inclusion (AWI) strategy is a public markets investment opportunity which uses a gender lens. Investors can use the strategy to track one of four broad-based equity indices (S&P 500, MSCI AWCI, MSCI EAFE, and Russell 3000). Aperio seeks to match the beta, or risk level, of the relevant index while increasing the "social score" of the overall portfolio. The AWI scoring strategy uses what is commonly referred to as a "best in class" ESG methodology to apply weights to the underlying companies in order to improve the portfolio characteristics in regards to gender issues."

Individuals invest in a variety of ways: they can invest directly as 'retail' investors, purchasing stocks and shares from an investment broker, or investing in pooled schemes such as OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts and investment trusts managed by fund managers.  People can also invest indirectly when they put money in pensions and other retirement schemes, or life insurance policies.  

The finance 'supply chain' refers to the ecosystem of organizations that provide products, services, information, and advice, and that sit between the investor and the investee corporation. 
We've illustrated here a very simplified view of the finance supply chain, highlighting just the key players - the key roles - that enable money to flow to businesses so they can grow. Sometimes these roles correspond to distinct organizations, and sometimes they're housed within other organizations. For example, a 'Legal Advisor' may work in specialized law firm, or may be housed within a 'professional services' firm, such as an auditor, consultant, investment bank, etc. 
Note also that the focus of this roadmap is the creation a finance system that will fuel more sustainable business operations. There are, of course, many other critiques of finance: that irresponsible 'financial engineering' creates undue systemic risk, or that finance now pulls too much money and talent away from the 'real economy'. Issues like these require their own analysis, and we have not addressed them here.

Proxy voting is the corporate equivalent of an absentee ballot, and enables shareholders to 'vote their shares' on the ballot questions that are part of the corporation's annual general meeting (AGM).

The variety of funds and fund managers who invest in diversified portfolios on the behalf of their clients. Diversified funds provide a beneficial diffusion of risk, but also a diffusion of responsibility and transparency. 

Fund managers pool money from many different investors – to form the 'fund' – and then purchase a variety of equities on behalf of those investors. They are tasked with finding a balance between maximizing financial returns – by buying shares in profitable and/or growing companies – while at the same time managing risk through diversified holdings.

%	11.6.6	InvestmentConsultants	Investment Consultants																	InvestmentAdvisors											
Investment consultants advise asset owners on how and where they should invest. They help owners set up investment policies and strategies, meet risk/return goals, choose fund managers, etc. 
Investment consultants are key players because of their position: mediating between asset owners and fund managers. 
On one side, consultants advise asset owners on which fund managers have the most appropriate investment processes and strategies, and asset owners place considerable authority in their views. This is particularly the case in the UK, the United States, and Canada. 
On the other side, fund managers strive to impress consultants with their approach to investing. To win business, fund managers must convince consultants that they have the people, investment philosophy and processes that will deliver consistent performance. Consequently, fund managers spend a considerable amount of time and effort focusing on the areas that investment consultants deem important. 
Investment consultants are thus a significant link in the finance supply chain, and highly relevant to policy makers, as they influence both the investors' choice of fund managers, as well as what fund managers focus on.

Individuals invest in a variety of ways: they can invest directly as 'retail' investors, purchasing stocks and shares from an investment broker, or investing in pooled schemes such as OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts and investment trusts managed by fund managers. People can also invest indirectly when they put money in pensions and other retirement schemes, or life insurance policies.

Completes the picture of the economy: connecting the investment of financial capital, to the production and consumption of goods and services, to the realization of income that comes back to repay investors.
To close-the-loop on the flow of money, we need to connect the financial economy to the 'real economy', following the flow of products and money around through production and consumption. 
The buying and selling of tangible products and services is sometimes referred to as the 'real economy' as it deals in concrete useful things. It is contrasted with the 'symbolic economy' of the financial system because finance trades in abstract representations of ownership or money – or the even more intangible futures-contracts and derivatives. But the symbolic economy is critical to the 'real' one as it provides the capital that fuels innovation and growth. And capital markets provide the risk diffusion that enables that money to flow.


%	12.5	Income	Income																	Goods&ServicesSupplyChain											
Income and profit is the key driver of the business and finance system. The projections of 'future cash flows' – how large they will be, how risky they are – is the key metric used by both investors and corporate managers as they decide how to use financial capital. Anything that affects future cash flow projections will have a big impact on where money is invested. 
%	12.6	Consumption	Consumption																	Goods&ServicesSupplyChain											
Consumers have great potential to influence what gets produced – and how it's produced. The consumer's power to influence exists in both the 'real economy' – as we decide which goods and services to buy – and in the financial economy as we make decisions about where we put our savings and what financial services to use. 
%	12.7	Production	Production																	Goods&ServicesSupplyChain

Data providers and data analysis agencies are at different points in the journey to incorporating appropriate tools and practices into their work in order to provide more comprehensive market insights.  These providers are known historically as financial data vendors and therefore data sets on which investment decisions are made remain largely traditional and predominantly focused on profitability, despite recent pressures to provide assessments relating to sustainability.  A gender lens applied to investment strategies will require the adoption of a broader consistent data set which as yet does not exist across the investment landscape.  There are a few initiatives in which gender is to be used as a factor of analysis in ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) however these are still not consistent analysis nor systematically applied.

Information about finance, economics, and environmental issues across all kinds of media. 

The way that gender lens is portrayed in the media can influence the thinking across the institutional investment supply chain: from beneficiaries through to corporate managers.  Media and campaigning can play an important role in keeping gender lens on the agenda and providing a constructive view of finance as a vital part of the solution, while also dispelling the debilitating notions of uncertainty, powerlessness, and shifting of responsibility. Media channels have the responsibility of promoting relevant and truthful information to people.   

Momentum has been building up and across the world people are mobilising behind the women equality agenda.  Engaged consumers will demand more socially responsible products and services, including investment products.  Engaged and well informed citizens will require government leadership in important issues.    Media plays a key role in raising awareness of the issues, creating conversations around difficult questions and promoting people's voices to make the required changes to the system.
